                Hello, I'm Oscar Grajeda. I'm 25 years old, and I'm the oldest of three. I graduated from Dobson
                High School in 2014, afterwards I attended community college for four years and didn't find anything to major in. It was very difficult for me to find something I enjoyed and/or wanted to persue as a career so I gave up college and dedited to work until I found something worth my time and money.

                Luckily I was introduced to coding in early 2020 by a friend. That led me to doing extensive
                research and that's how I found Univercity of Arizona's Coding Bootcamp. It has been challenging
                but also fun since day one (yes I said fun). To my surprise I ended up really liking the world
                of Web Development.
